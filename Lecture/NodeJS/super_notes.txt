NodeJS

What is it?
	- JS that can run somewhere OTHER than a browser
	- Built on the v8 JS engine
		- Really focused on performance
		- Garbage collection
		- Object Property Lookups
	- Command Line Interface

Node vs Browser
	- No window object / process.global will be the global namespace
	- No DOM / no document object
	- Hardware access (cpus, gps, bluetooth, etc)!

One of the big objects you can access in node is called `process`
	- Arguments can be passed into a node file when run from the command line
		- they live at the `argv` property

Module system
	- How you can access other files / libraries (3rd party modules) / built-in (core) modules
	- 2 major components
		- REQUIRE : how you include a module in a file
		- MODULE.EXPORTS : how you export information FROM a file
